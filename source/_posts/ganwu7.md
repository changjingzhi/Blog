# what is important in life？（生命中什么最重要？）

### Today, I can't help but ask myself what is most important in life. I don't think I can answer the question because I don't know how to answer the question. But I think I may have a clue to this problem, thinking from my 20 years of experience, I often worry about what I don't have, but the result of worrying is only worrying itself, which does nothing to change the status quo, or makes the result worse. I thought I needed to get rid of this worry, so I saw death, I saw history, the flow of the past, the men. I have learned that nothing is permanent in the face of death, and that time diminishes everything. So I saw the past, the future, in the past regret and anxiety about the future saw the present, the past is gone, the future future, instead of falling into the past regret and anxiety about the future, why not change a mentality to spend the present. Life has no meaning, instead of blindly looking for the meaning of the castle in the air, it is better to spend the present with gratitude for the past and hope for the future. Look to the future based on the present, not to worry about the future, the future is not to worry, but to create. For the present attitude, not happy with things, not sad. Lief is short, kiss slowly, laugh insanely, love truly and forgive quickly.

### 今天，我情不自禁的问自己生命中什么最重要。我想我不能回答这个问题的答案，因为我不知道怎么去回答这个问题的答案。但是我想我或许有一点关于这个问题线索，从我20年中的经历来思考，我经常为自己所未拥有的事物所忧虑，但是忧虑的结果只能是忧虑本身，对现状没有一点改变，或者导致结果更坏。我想我需要摆脱这种忧虑，于是我看到了死亡，看到了历史，往事流转，风流人物。又有多少存在于世上，我学到了在死亡面前没有什么是永恒的，时间会冲淡一切。于是我看到了过去、未来，在对过去的悔恨和对未来的焦虑中看到了当下，过去已逝，未来未来，与其陷入对过去的悔恨中和对未来的焦虑中，为什么不换一个心态去度过当下。人生本来就没有意义，与其去一味的寻找那空中楼阁的意义，不如怀着对过去的感恩于对未来的期盼去度过当下。基于现状去展望明天，而不是去忧虑未来，未来不是是用来忧虑的，而是用来创造的。对于当下的态度，不以物喜，不以及悲，要发自内心的开心，发自内心的悲伤。既然生命如此短暂，那么慢慢地亲吻，尽情地欢笑，真心去爱，快快的原谅吧！
