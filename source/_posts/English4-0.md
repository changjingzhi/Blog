## 第一段听力
1-4题： 对话
M: How's your dissertation going? Fm proofreading my first draft and will submit it to my professor tomorrow.
M：你的论文写得怎么样了？我在校对我的初稿，明天就会提交给我的教授。


W: Oh, (1) I haven't even started writing mine yet, so I'm really worried about finishing by the end of next semester.
W：哦，我还没开始写呢，所以我很担心能否在下学期结束前完成。

M: You mean you haven't even begun yours yet? The final draft is due in five months.
M：你是说你还没开始写？最终稿在五个月后就要交了。

W: Of course Fve started it, but I can't get to the writing yet as I haven't found enough resources to use, so I'm still researching the topic.
W：当然开始了，但还没能动笔，因为还没找到足够的资料，所以还在研究主题。

M: Maybe the problem is the way you're doing your research. (2) I started by talking to my professor about where to look for information. And based on that, I found books in the library and a lot of reputable journal articles on the Internet.
M：也许问题出在你做研究的方法上。我一开始就和教授讨论了该去哪里找信息。然后根据这些信息，我在图书馆找到了书籍，并在网上找到了很多可信的期刊文章。

W: I've tried all that, but don't have enough to write the dissertation as my department's minimum length is 70 pages. I think the problem is that my topic isn't viable. (3) And honestly, my professor did warn me at the beginning that I might not be able to find enough material. But I was so interested in the topic that I didn't let his advice to turn me.
W：我试过这些，但还是不够写论文，因为我们系的最低篇幅要求是70页。我觉得问题在于我的主题不太可行。而且，说实话，我的教授一开始就警告我，可能找不到足够的资料。但我对这个主题太感兴趣了，没有听从他的建议。

M: Well, I suggest you find a new topic. After all, our professors are here to guide us, so it's best to listen to them.
M：我建议你换个主题。毕竟，教授在这里是为了指导我们，所以最好听从他们的建议。

W: In retrospect, I wish I had listened to him, but I didn't. And now I don't want to give up my topic as I've already invested so much time and energy.
W：回想起来，我希望当时听了他的建议，但我没有。现在我不想放弃这个主题，因为我已经投入了太多的时间和精力。

M: If you're committed to your current topic, maybe you could make some adjustments rather than abandon it completely. What is your topic?
M：如果你坚持现有的主题，也许可以做一些调整，而不是完全放弃。你的主题是什么？

W: It's "Depictions of Femininity and Folklore from the South of the Country".
W：是“南部地区民俗中的女性形象描绘”。

M: That's pretty narrow. You could find more material if you made the topic broader, maybe by including other kinds of depictions.
M：这个主题确实很狭窄。如果把主题扩展一点，比如包括其他类型的描绘，可能会找到更多的资料。

W: (4) Broadening the topic is a great idea. I'll start by including folklore from other regions of the country.
W：扩展主题是个好主意。我会先从包括其他地区的民俗开始。

5-8题：对话
W: Today, on Book Talk, we are lucky enough to host John Robbins and discuss his new book, Why Americans Are Fat and How We Can Lose Weight. (5-1) John isn't just a respected writer；he's also one of the rare celebrity authors writing about science today.
W：今天在《书籍访谈》节目中，我们很荣幸邀请到约翰·罗宾斯来讨论他的新书《为什么美国人肥胖以及我们如何减肥》。约翰不仅是一位受人尊敬的作家，他也是当今为数不多的撰写科学类作品的名人作者之一。

M: Thanks for having me, Rebecca, but I'm hardly a celebrity.
M：谢谢你的邀请，丽贝卡，但我可不算是名人。

W: That's very modest of you to say, (5-2) considering that your four books have sold a total of seven million copies worldwide, and they've been translated into 12 different languages. What makes people so fascinated with your work?
W：你这么说真是太谦虚了，考虑到你的四本书在全球总共卖出了七百万册，并且被翻译成了12种不同的语言。是什么让人们对你的作品如此着迷？

M: (6) Well, people read my books because more than 60% of Americans are overweight or obese. And other countries are facing similar problems. Basically, we all want to know how to fix things.
M：嗯，人们读我的书是因为超过60%的美国人超重或肥胖。而其他国家也面临类似的问题。基本上，我们都想知道如何解决这些问题。

W: We certainly do. I've read your new book and it's fabulous, especially when it comes to the way you make difficult science easy for laymen to understand. That's no small achievement.
W：我们确实如此。我读了你的新书，真是太棒了，尤其是你让普通人能够理解复杂的科学。这可不是件容易的事。

M: I'm glad to hear you find my work accessible, because I was worried when I wrote it that discussing the science might make the book more suited for a specialist audience. (7) My last book was written primarily for the medical community. But this time, I want to help ordinary people take control of their weight. 
M：很高兴听到你觉得我的作品通俗易懂，因为我写这本书时担心讨论科学内容会让它更适合专业观众。我上一本书主要是为医学界写的。但这次，我希望能帮助普通人控制他们的体重。

W: And how do you suggest they do that? Can you give us the basics of your advice for people who want to lose weight?
W：那你建议他们怎么做呢？你能给我们讲讲你的减肥建议的基本要点吗？

M: Briefly, (8) I argue that every person needs to sn sid er their metabolism and eat what suits their body's needs. I don't advocate one single diet. Some people should eat more carbohydrates than others. And different people need different amounts of protein and fat.
M：简单来说，我认为每个人都需要考虑他们的新陈代谢，并吃适合他们身体需求的食物。我不提倡单一的饮食。有些人应该比其他人吃更多的碳水化合物。而不同的人需要不同量的蛋白质和脂肪。

W: But you do have some recommendations for everyone, including eating ten servings of vegetables and three of fruit a day. We'll talk about those recommendations next, but now we need to take a short break for a message from our sponsor.
W：但是你确实有一些对所有人的建议，包括每天吃十份蔬菜和三份水果。我们接下来会讨论这些建议，但现在我们需要休息一下，听一段赞助商的信息。

Stress is often depicted as negative, but research shows that moderate amounts of it can be beneficial for your brain and your body.
压力通常被认为是负面的，但研究表明，适量的压力对你的大脑和身体是有益的。

First, the benefits for the brain. Studies have shown that short periods of stress can actually bolster cognitive functioning. (9) Researchers discovered that placing rats in a stressful situation for just a few hours doubled the growth of new brain cells. The rats also did better on a memory test later on. Scientists think the same thing happens in humans. But how does stress improve memory? It's simple. When your brain cells multiply, your memory can improve. Viewed from a biological perspective, this makes sense, (10) because animals that are better at remembering dangerous situations can avoid them in the future. If an animal encounters a predator and escapes, for example, it's important to remember where and when that encounter happened. Experts assert that the same principle applies to humans.
首先是对大脑的好处。研究表明，短时间的压力实际上可以增强认知功能。研究人员发现，让老鼠在一个有压力的环境中呆上几个小时，新的脑细胞的生长量会翻倍。这些老鼠在后来的记忆测试中表现得更好。科学家们认为同样的事情也会发生在人类身上。但是压力是如何改善记忆的呢？这很简单。当你的脑细胞增多时，你的记忆力就能得到提升。从生物学的角度来看，这是有道理的，因为能更好记住危险情况的动物可以在未来避免这些情况。例如，如果一只动物遇到捕食者并成功逃脱，那么记住那次遭遇的时间和地点就非常重要。专家们断言，同样的原理也适用于人类。

Now, let's turn to how stress benefits the body. This may come as a surprise to laymen. But experts say that stress can keep you from getting sick. (11) Scientists concede that chronic stress can make you more prone to illness. But research shows that short periods of stress can actually provide some protection against getting sick, because it increases your immune functioning. One study shows that rats that experienced brief stress had a surge of immune cell response, which makes the immune system better prepared to fight illness. For humans, there's even evidence that experiencing stress before getting vaccinated could help make vaccines more effective.
现在，让我们看看压力是如何对身体有益的。这可能会让普通人感到惊讶。但专家们表示，压力可以防止你生病。科学家们承认，长期的压力会使你更容易生病。但研究表明，短时间的压力实际上可以提供一些防病的保护，因为它可以增强你的免疫功能。一项研究显示，经历短暂压力的老鼠，其免疫细胞反应会激增，使免疫系统更好地准备好对抗疾病。对于人类来说，还有证据表明，在接种疫苗前经历压力可以帮助提高疫苗的有效性。

12-15：短文
For many managers and people who work in leadership positions, dealing with emails is a dilemma. It's likely the unpredictable, uncontrollable and ongoing nature of day-to-day email in terms of volume, importance and urgency contributes to their levels of anxiety and to diminished leadership skills. That's because it's not unusual for many leaders to prioritize email management over people management. An obsession with managing their inbox prevents them from dealing with their employees.

对于许多管理者和领导岗位上的人来说，处理电子邮件是一种困境。日常电子邮件在数量、重要性和紧迫性方面的不可预测性、不可控性和持续性可能导致他们的焦虑水平上升，并削弱他们的领导技能。这是因为许多领导者往往优先处理电子邮件，而不是管理人员。他们对管理收件箱的痴迷阻碍了他们与员工的互动。

(13) As a result, they ignore the issues that might only be mild problems at first, until unfortunately, they inevitably transform into a major problem or crisis by virtue of neglect. (14) As leaders, they are expected to motivate and inspire their team in pursuit of longer term strategic goals and also, less ambitiously but more practically, to monitor their daily output, to set clear expectations, and to give regular feedback. When presented with a choice between the appeal of their inbox and other more important activities, many sacrifice the latter. Daily email demands have a negative impact on their goal progress. This is because leaders must divert resources from other tasks to check, filter and respond to emails.

因此，他们忽视了最初可能只是轻微问题的事项，直到这些问题因为被忽视而不可避免地演变成重大问题或危机。作为领导者，他们被期望能够激励和激发团队，以追求长期的战略目标，同时也需要实际地监控团队的日常工作，设定明确的期望，并给予定期的反馈。然而，在面对收件箱的吸引力和其他更重要的活动时，许多人选择牺牲后者。日常的电子邮件需求对他们的目标进展产生了负面影响。这是因为领导者必须将资源从其他任务上转移出来，以检查、过滤和回复电子邮件。

(15) The solution is cultivating self-control which is like a muscle- - it can be strengthened or improved over time through exercise. Some suggestions include making space in your diary for the only periods during which you'll be checking emails, setting a timer for yourself so you don't become distracted by your inbox for too long, turning off email alerts so you're not interrupted by them.

解决方案是培养自我控制力，这就像一块肌肉——通过锻炼可以得到加强或改善。一些建议包括在日程表中留出专门检查电子邮件的时间段，为自己设定一个计时器，以免因处理收件箱而分散注意力太久，关闭电子邮件提醒，以免被其打断。

Appear to be submissive, humble, grateful and undemanding; show great pleasure when a doctor comes into your room, even if the visit is brief and useless. Don't challenge anyone with authority unless you are famous or very rich.

显得顺从、谦卑、感激且不过分要求；即使医生的拜访短暂而无用，也要表现出极大的喜悦。当医生进入你的房间时，不要挑战任何权威，除非你非常有名或非常富有。

Those are a few strategies for dealing with today's American medical establishment. (16)What patients want is to be treated with respect and consideration. But in my experience, too few hospitals and doctors are ready to do that. In his book, A Whole New Life, novelist Reynolds Price recalls that his doctors chose a crowded hallway as the place to tell him he might have a tumor on his spinal cord. It did not occur to the two physicians that a hallway was not the most appropriate place for that particular piece of news.

这些是应对当今美国医疗体制的一些策略。患者希望得到尊重和体贴的对待。但在我的经验中，很少有医院和医生准备这样做。在他的书《全新生活》中，小说家雷诺兹·普莱斯回忆起，他的医生选择在一个拥挤的走廊里告诉他，他的脊髓上可能有肿瘤。这两位医生没有想到，走廊不是传达这一消息的最合适地点。

My surgeon, who is in his mid-thirties, looks tired. He has been overwhelmed with patients who have fallen on the winter ice. He is a witty man, but sometimes his wit is unwelcome.

我的外科医生大约三十多岁，看起来很疲惫。他被在冬天冰面上摔倒的患者压得喘不过气来。他是个机智的人，但有时他的机智并不受欢迎。

"The health insurance company Blue Cross wants me to put you out in the snow tomorrow afternoon,n he tells me after I have been in the hospital for more than a week. I'm terrified because I have no idea where to go. I cannot walk or even lift my leg a few inches. The hospital social worker strikes me as an idiot. But my complaints about her only annoy my surgeon. "I have to work with these people," he tells my friend, Dr. Karen Brudlney, when she mercifully intervenes on my behalf and arranges for me to be transferred to another hospital.

“健康保险公司Blue Cross希望我明天下午把你赶出去，”在我住院超过一周后，他这样告诉我。我感到害怕，因为我不知道该去哪里。我不能走路，甚至不能抬起几英寸的腿。医院的社会工作者让我觉得她是个白痴。但我对她的抱怨只会惹恼我的外科医生。当我的朋友Karen Brudney医生仁慈地为我说情并安排我转到另一家医院时，他告诉她：“我不得不与这些人一起工作。”

"If you say one negative thing, they get defensive,"she tells me later. "They have this kind of institutional loyalty. (17)Always bring an advocate, that is, any other person with you to the hospital, and write down every single question and the answer, the name of every doctor and nurse. When people know you have their names, they behave better. And," Brudney adds, "if you, as a patient, suggest that you might like to control even part of the situation or be consulted or informed, then you are considered difficult. (18)They want you to be totally passive, The entire health care system, particularly hospitals and nursing homes, exists for reasons that have nothing to do with taking care of patients. Patients are incidental."

“如果你说一句负面的话，他们会变得很防御，”她后来告诉我。“他们有这种机构忠诚感。永远带一个支持者，也就是任何其他人，和你一起去医院，记录下每一个问题和答案，每一个医生和护士的名字。当人们知道你有他们的名字时，他们会表现得更好。而且，”Brudney补充说，“如果你作为患者建议你可能希望控制甚至部分情况，或者被咨询或告知，那么你会被认为很难缠。他们希望你完全被动，整个医疗系统，特别是医院和疗养院的存在，原因与照顾病人无关。病人只是附带的。”

19-21

There are probably teams you're worked with but you never want to work with again. But there must have also been other teams that you would prize reuniting with professionally. In other words, your team had vitality. (19)Vitality comes about when the ties people form with their fellow team members are such that they stay connected even after the team breaks up.

你可能有一些团队合作的经历，不希望再次合作，但也一定有一些团队，你会珍视与之再次合作的机会。换句话说，你的团队充满活力。团队活力的产生在于成员之间建立的联系，即使团队解散后，这些联系依然保持。

What characteristics of a team make its members more likely to stay in contact despite no longer working together? This question has been answered recently in a study published in a business journal.

什么样的团队特征使成员在不再一起工作后仍然保持联系？这个问题在最近发表在商业期刊的一项研究中得到了回答。

One of the two key factors the research team discovered is sameness. Specifically, sharing the same gender or ethnic origin. (20)The more members of a team share similar demographics, the more inclined they will be to remain associates long after the team has served its purpose. After ties are established, similarity strengthens them. As a result, they regard these individuals with greater trust and mutual understanding, which motivates them to seek further opportunities for collaboration. In effect, people tend to create stronger and longer-lasting connections with similar others, Someone who looks and sounds different from us may have the resources we need to be more successful. Yet, we find then to be significantly less credible simply because they are different. If you are a fierce advocate of workplace diversity, youll no doubt be horrified by such a revelation.

研究团队发现的两个关键因素之一是相似性。具体来说，是指成员在性别或种族上的相似性。团队成员共享相似的人口统计特征时，他们更倾向于在团队任务完成后继续保持联系。相似性在关系建立后进一步加强这些关系。结果是，成员之间会有更大的信任和相互理解，推动他们寻找进一步合作的机会。人们往往与相似的人建立更强、更持久的联系。尽管与我们看起来和听起来不同的人可能拥有我们成功所需的资源，但我们仅仅因为他们的不同而觉得他们不可信。如果你是职场多样性的强烈倡导者，那么这样的发现无疑会令你震惊。

The second factor identified by the researchers is the quality of the relationships among the team members. The more they trust one another, share the same goals and depend on each other for the achievement of those goals, the stronger their chances of maintaining their connections, despite no longer working as one team. Teams with quality relationships have a shared belief that ifs safe to take risks with each ether, and their members are obliged to share the workload and help out.

研究人员发现的第二个因素是团队成员之间关系的质量。成员之间的信任、共同的目标以及彼此依赖实现这些目标的程度越高，即使不再作为一个团队工作，他们保持联系的可能性也越大。高质量关系的团队成员相信彼此之间冒险是安全的，并且有义务分担工作量和帮助他人。

From personal experience, I can see both the truth and the inconsistency of such studies. The truth is some of my closest friendships were formed as a result of having worked together on teams, and I actively seek opportunities to work with them again. (21)The inconsistency, though, is that Pve never worked for a team more successful and cohesive than the one of which I am a member right now. And yet, the four of us have very little in common and are completely different demographically. So I am unlikely to question the value of a diverse workforce.

从个人经验来看，我能看到这些研究的真相和不一致性。真相是，我一些最亲密的友谊是通过团队合作形成的，我也积极寻找再次与他们合作的机会。然而，不一致的是，我从未在一个比我现在的团队更成功和凝聚力更强的团队中工作过。尽管我们四个人几乎没有共同点，且在人口统计上完全不同。因此，我不可能质疑多样化团队的价值。

22-25

An American researcher who studied 600 millionaires found how rich you can get comes down to six wealth factors. She found that six behaviors are related to net worth potential, regardless of age or income. These were thriftiness, confidence, responsibility, planning, focus and social indifference.

一位研究了600名百万富翁的美国研究人员发现，财富的积累可以归结为六个关键因素。她发现，无论年龄或收入如何，有六种行为与净资产潜力相关：节俭、自信、责任感、计划、专注和社会冷漠。

Being thrifty comes as no great surprise. Spending above your means, spending instead of saving for retirement, spending in anticipation of becoming wealthy, makes you a slave to the paycheck. (22)"Even with an astronomical level of income," she wrote, "to properly build wealth, experts recommend saving 20% of your income and living off the remaining 80%."

节俭是一个显而易见的因素。超出自己经济能力的消费、用消费代替储蓄退休金、期待未来变富而花钱，这些行为都会让你成为薪水的奴隶。她写道：“即使收入水平极高，为了正确积累财富，专家建议储蓄收入的20%，并用剩下的80%生活。”

Having confidence is another key characteristic, as it helps people to be thrifty. (23)It takes confidence to live within your means. It also takes confidence to invest properly. Instead of making investing decisions with your emotions, financial planners advise that you should leave your investments alone and focus on a long term investment plan. But people can't invest or manage their own money without accepting responsibility for the outcomes. Many millionaires take on personal responsibility, and most also happen to be self-made, meaning they didn't acquire their wealth through luck. (24)Millionaires don't count on anyone else to make them rich, and they dorft blame anyone else if they fall short. They focus on things they can control and align their daily habits to the goals they have set for themselves. They tend to be goal-oriented and hard workers, which enables them to plan financially and focus on seeing those plans through. 92% of the milionaires surveyed developed a longtenn plan for their money and 97% almost always achieved the goals they set for themselves.

自信是另一个关键特征，因为它有助于人们保持节俭。生活在自己经济能力范围内需要自信，正确投资也需要自信。财务规划师建议，不要用情绪来做投资决策，而是要坚持长期的投资计划。但是，人们不能在没有承担结果责任的情况下投资或管理自己的钱。许多百万富翁承担个人责任，而且大多数是自力更生，这意味着他们的财富不是靠运气获得的。百万富翁不依赖其他人使他们变富，如果未能达到目标，他们也不责怪别人。他们专注于自己能控制的事情，并将日常习惯与自己设定的目标对齐。他们通常是目标导向和勤奋的，这使他们能够制定财务计划并专注于实现这些计划。调查的百万富翁中，92%制定了长期的财务计划，97%几乎总是实现了自己设定的目标。

And it is these behaviors that make it easy for them to be socially indifferent. They resist lifestyle creep, the tendency to spend more whenever one earns more. (25)Essentially, they don't yield to pressure to buy the latest thing or to keep up with others or what they have acquired. Instead of being focused on what might make them happy today, they're focused on their long-term wealth-building plan.

这些行为使他们能够轻松地在社会上保持冷漠。他们抵制生活方式攀升的趋势，即收入增加时花费更多。他们不会屈服于购买最新产品或与他人攀比的压力，而是专注于他们的长期财富积累计划。
