## 第一篇

Direction： For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to writer an essay entitled Be Willing to Try by commenting on the remark 'In every triumph, there's a lot of try.' You can cite examples to illustrate your point. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.

The answer essay for example.

Be willing to Try

Anyone who has made achievements has the courage to try. No try, no innovation; no innovation , no succes. Therefore, every accomplishment starts with tring. That's why Frank Tyger said that in every triumph, there's a lot of try.
任何取得成就的人都有勇气尝试。不尝试，就没有创新；没有创新，就没有成功。因此，每一项成就都始于尝试。这就是为什么弗兰克·泰格说，每一个胜利的背后，都有很多的尝试。

There are many reasons to account for this argument. For ont thing, being williing to try is a sure sign that a man dares to challenge himself. When you decide to try, you will take a big step forward to challenge yourself, and hence it may be the beginning of success. For another, the process of trying is also the process of exploring your potential. When you attempt to do something , you will fing that you have inexhaustible potential. If not to try, these potential will never have the chance to shine.
这个观点有很多原因。一方面，愿意尝试是一个人敢于挑战自我的明显标志。当你决定尝试时，你就迈出了挑战自我的重要一步，这可能是成功的开始。另一方面，尝试的过程也是探索自身潜力的过程。当你尝试去做某件事时，你会发现自己拥有取之不尽的潜力。如果不去尝试，这些潜力将永远没有机会展现。

To try is a way to create a great and outstanding life; it is also an important way leading to success. Everyone can, in the end, get what he wants if he constantly tries. Therefore, oncce an idea comes to your mind, just take action to have a try.
尝试是一种创造卓越生活的方式；也是通向成功的重要途径。如果一个人不断尝试，最终每个人都能得到自己想要的。因此，一旦有了想法，就行动起来去尝试吧。


首先，经典的没有看懂问题说的是什么？ Be willing to try ，翻译过来是什么？愿意尝试


## 第二篇

Directions: Suppose you are asked to give advice on whether shared bikes will be the most popular transportation means in the near future. Write an essay to state your opinion. You should write at lest 150 words but more than 200 words.

title : My View on Shared 

Shared bikes in different color have sprung up on the city streets almost overninght. Despite the convenience they offer, it is highly unlikely that shared bikes will be most popular means of transporttation in the future. 
不同颜色的共享单车几乎一夜之间出现在城市街道上。尽管它们提供了便利，但共享单车在未来成为最受欢迎的交通工具的可能性微乎其微。

Firstly, equipped with GPS and digital lock, shared bikes are only available to the target customers. That means user must have a smartphone, download apps and know how to unlock the bikes. Moreover, bike-sharing thrives only in traffic-clogged cities where it is the best method to solve the problem of the lastmile transportation. Secondly, as shared bikes pour into or populated regions, they, like cars, can inevitably create new traffic problems. Thirdly, huge investments must be used to maintain services, updata aspps  and expand operation. In other words, more and more start-ups will flounder because of the lack of investment.
首先，配备了 GPS 和数字锁的共享单车仅对目标用户开放。这意味着用户必须拥有智能手机，下载应用程序并知道如何解锁单车。此外，共享单车在交通拥堵的城市中蓬勃发展，因为它是解决最后一公里交通问题的最佳方法。其次，随着共享单车涌入人口密集地区，它们像汽车一样不可避免地会造成新的交通问题。第三，维护服务、更新应用程序和扩展运营需要巨额投资。换句话说，越来越多的初创公司将因缺乏投资而面临困境。


To summarize, bike-sharing is a must in today's urban transportation system, but it won't  be a leader among transportation means.
总之，共享单车在今天的城市交通系统中必不可少，但它不会成为交通工具中的领军者。
